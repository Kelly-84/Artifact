cardslist = [
    'The World\nfulfillment, harmony, completion, \nTo encounter the World in your cards is to encounter a great unity and wholeness. It symbolizes the moment     when the inner and the outer worlds - self and other - become a single entity. In some traditions, this state is described as enlightenment, or nirvana.'
    ,'The World Reversed\nincompletion, no closure \nYou are drawing near to something that marks the end of a journey or an era. You may have many accomplishments that have lined your path, but there is a strange emptiness that fills you when you look backwards upon it, as if you have all the pieces but they are not coming together.'
    ,'Judgement\nreflection, reckoning, awakening \nThe traditional Judgement meaning focuses on the moment when we reflect and evaluate ourselves and our actions. It is through self-reflection that we can have a clearer and objective understanding about where we are now, and what we need to do in order to grow as humans. The Judgement card appearing in a reading signifies that you are coming close to this significant point in your life where you must start to evaluate yourself.'
    ,'Judgement Reversed\nlack of self awareness, doubt, self loathing\nThe reversed Judgement card can mean that you doubt and judge yourself too harshly. This could be causing you to miss opportunities that were awaiting you. The lost momentum causes you to fall behind in your plans, which can make it difficult to move forward. This means that you should not be cautious, but you should be moving forward with pride and confidence'
    ,'Sun\njoy, success, celebration, positivity\nBecause of your own personal fulfillment, you provide others with inspiration and joy as well. People are drawn to you because they are capable of seeing the warm and beautiful energy which you bring into their lives. You are also in a position in which you are capable of sharing your qualities as well as achievements with other people. You radiate love and affection towards those you care about the most'
    ,'Sun Reversed\nnegativity, depression, sadness\nthe Sun indicates that you might have significant difficulties finding positive aspects to certain situations. The clouds might be blocking out the warmth and light that you need to progress. This might be preventing you from feeling confident and powerful. You may experience certain setbacks which are damaging your optimism and enthusiasm. On the other hand, the Sun reversed might be indicative that you are being unrealistic. It might be a sign that you have an overly optimistic perception of certain situations.'
    ,'Moon\nunconscious, illusions, intuition\nYou need to be aware of the situations that are causing fear and anxiety in your mind, whether it is now or in the future. It alerts you not to allow inner disturbances and self-deception to take the best of you. These deep memories and fears must be let go, and the negative energies must be released and turned into something constructive. Another reading of the Moon card is the existence of illusion. Some hidden truth must be discovered, for what you are seeing now may just be a trick of the light. '
    ,'Moon Reversed\nconfusion, fear, misinterpretation\nThe moon reversal meaning indicates that you are in an intuitive period or you have recently battled confusion, anxiety, and self-deception. It could be that you are misinterpreting how you have been feeling however you are starting to improve on this. Another reversed moon meaning is that the forces of the night that are bringing you confusion are starting to dissipate. You have started managing your fears and anxiety'
    ,'Star\nhope, faith, rejuvenation\n To receive the Star in your reading means that you have gone and passed through a terrible life challenge. You have managed to go through this without losing your hope. While you suffered, you perhaps were not aware of your own strength, but you are now perhaps recognizing that the loss helped you discover your own resilience and inner power. It is only now that you can really appreciate all that you have.'
    ,'Star Reversed\nfaithlessness, discouragement, insecurity\nWhen the Star card is reversed, it means that you are feeling as though everything has turned against you. The challenges that you would normally see as exciting seem instead to make you feel as though you cannot overcome them. You have lost faith in something, whether inside yourself or with something you normally find dear. Without hope, without faith, we cannot find the motivation to progress forward in the challenges that we face. '
    ,'Tower\nsudden upheaval, broken pride, disaster\nThe Tower represents change in the most radical and momentous sense. It is for this reason that the card itself visually looks so unnerving. But it doesnt necessarily have to be truly frightening or ominous. Because at the heart of this card, its message is foundational, groundbreaking change. The kind of event that the Tower card marks does not have to be something terrible, like a disaster or a great loss.  Change itself is a normal part of life that one has to embrace. But it can sometimes strike fear, for it means that we must abandon the truths that we have known prior to this event. The old ways are no longer useful, and you must find another set of beliefs, values and processes to take their place.'
    ,'Tower Reversed\ndisaster avoided, delayed disaster, fear of suffering \nWhen you get the Tower card reversed, you can feel some crisis looming along the horizon, and you are struggling as much as you can to try and avoid its manifestation. What you have not realized is that these breakdowns can be beneficial in breaking down your reliance on something that is false. The tower is built on faulty foundations, and it must fall. Though the destruction will be painful, the humbleness resulting from it can bring us peace.'
    ,'Devil\naddiction, materialism, playfulness\nGetting the devil card in your reading shows that you have feelings of entrapment, emptiness and lack of fulfillment in your life. It might also mean that you are a slave to materialism and opulence and no matter how hard you try, you just canâ€™t seem to shake off the feeling of wanting to indulge in luxurious living. You might be aware that this kind of lifestyle is leading you down the rabbit hole, but you have that feeling of not having any form of control over your actions or urges.'
    ,'Devil Reversed\nfreedom, release, restoring control\nThe upside down meaning of the Devil card can be the moment when an individual becomes self-aware and breaks all of the chains that come with addiction and poor habits. It might be because they are tired of running in circles and are in need of change.'
    ,'Temperance\nmiddle path, patience, finding meaning\nThe Temperance card implies that you have a clear vision and know what you want to achieve. This is an indication of higher learning, which is a critical attribute in the journey of life. It reflects that you have found peace with what you are doing and everything is unfolding as it ought to. The Temperance card, in relation to other people, shows that you are able to adapt and work in harmony with your community, your coworkers and your loved ones. Your calmness in all matters gives them comfort and puts them at ease.'
    ,'Temperance Reversed\nextremes, excess, lack of balance \nTemperance in reversed is a reflection of something that is out of balance and may be causing stress and anxiety. The real meaning of the Temperance card can be deciphered using the other cards in the spread to identify areas where this imbalance is being caused. A Temperance in reversal may also be used as a warning;  if you take a certain path, it would lead to turbulence and excess.'
    ,'Death\nend of cycle, beginnings, change, metamorphosis\nThe real meaning within the Death card is one of the most positive in the whole deck. The Death card signals that one major phase in your life is ending, and a new one is going to start. You just need to close one door, so the new one will open. The past needs to be placed behind you, so you can focus your energy on what is ahead of you.'
    ,'Death Reversed\nfear of change, holding on, stagnation, decay \nThe Death reversal meaning is still about change, but that you have been resisting it. You could be worried about letting go of the past, or you could not be sure of the changes that you need to make to go forward. Resisting the change and holding onto the past can limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown. While you can still be afraid, you should trust that you are taking the right steps and move forward. Life moves on, so fighting passing time is only going to leave you with regrets.'
    ,'Hanged Man\nsacrifice, release, martyrdom\nThe Hanged Man card reflects a particular need to suspend certain action. As a result, this might indicate a certain period of indecision. This means that certain actions or decisions which need to be properly implemented are likely to be postponed even if there is an urgency to act at this particular moment. In fact, it would be ultimately the best if you are capable of stalling certain actions in order to ensure that you have more time to reflect on making critical decisions, this will ultimately be the best.'
    ,'Hanged Man Reversed\nstalling, needless sacrifice, fear of sacrifice\nThe reversal meaning of the Hanged Man card represents a very specific period of time during which you feel as if you are sacrificing a significant amount of time while getting nothing in return. You might have felt as if certain things are at a state of an absolute standstill without any particular resolution or movement. Itâ€™s as if you are putting your entire effort and attention into something but nothing turns out as it should.'
    ,'Justice\ncause and effect, clarity, truth\nThe decisions that you make now have long-term effects in all things, both for yourself and others. There will always come a time where you will be judged. The Justice tarot card appearing in a reading signals that a judgment will be made fairly and accordingly. The decisions that you have made in the past will be carefully weighed with fairness. Your feelings around this card may differ depending on your situation. If you have been wronged, this cards appearance may bring you relief. On the other hand, if your actions caused pain to others, this card serves as a warning. Her appearance represents a chance for you to change your actions now for a better future. When a tarot card reading shows the figure of justice, it is time to account for your actions.'
    ,'Justice Reversed\ndishonesty, unaccountability, unfairness\nA reversed Justice tarot card could indicate various things. One Justice reversal meaning is to show you are living in denial. You are not willing to accept the consequences of your actions or others. You are running from your guilt. You must however, be aware that these are actions that are in the past. Your future depends on your actions today - and what you will do to tip the scales in balance again. How can you make up for your wrongs? Taking action gives you a chance to change and stop judging yourself. In legal matters, this could represent an unfair outcome of a case that you will not accept.'
    ,'Wheel of Fortune\nchange, cycles, inevitable fate\nThe Wheel of Fortune turns evermore, seemingly to communicate that life is made up of both good and bad times, and that the cycle is one that we cannot control. It is something that is subjected to both kings and workers, and that nobody on earth can avoid what is fated. When you have good moments in your life, make sure that you enjoy to the fullest, for what comes up must always go down. The same is true in reverse - when you are in a bad situation, things will eventually become better again. '
    ,'Wheel of Fortune Reversed\nno control, clinging to control, bad luck\nWhen the wheel is reversed, it means that luck has not been on your side and misfortunes have been following you. When its associated with this card, you must understand that these are due to external influences that you cannot control. Like the wheel, our luck and our fate is always in motion, and sometimes we are on the bottom. Be assured that the wheel will turn again, and you will be okay again soon. '
    ,'Hermit\ncontemplation, search for truth, inner guidance\nThe Hermit is a seeker for the knowledge that comes from within. A lonely wanderer in the path of the night, he searches for that which can only be gained with long periods of solitude - the inner voice. To hear it, he must disconnect from the crowds whose voices and desires threaten to overcome his own. He walks through the dark night of his unconscious, guided only by the low light of the northern star, with his destination being his home, his self.'
    ,'Hermit Reversed\nloneliness, isolation, lost your way\nWhen reversed, you are perhaps in a situation where youd like to be alone; there is nothing wrong about that. However, there is a possibility that your seclusion may become harmful to both yourself and others. Though the Hermit sets forwards with noble intentions to search for his inner truth, his path inward may also be filled with great danger. Going inward may lead to madness and the abyss, for the unconscious is filled with images that he may not yet understand, lurking and waiting to lure you ever inside. Like a man that gets lost in his own dreams, the hermit may find himself stuck in a world of his own, alone, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human.'
    ,'Strength\ninner strength, bravery, compassion, focus\nWhen you get the Strength card in an upright manner during your tarot reading, then it shows that you have inner strength and fortitude during moments of danger and distress. It shows that you have the ability to remain calm and strong even when your life is going through immense struggle. It also shows that you are a compassionate person and you always have time for other people even if its at your own expense.'
    ,'Strength Reversed\nself doubt, weakness, insecurity\nAn upside down Strength card can mean that you are (or about to) experience an intense anger or fear in your life. You seem to be lacking the inner strength that this card normally represents, meaning you might be experiencing fear, and a lack of conviction and confidence in your own abilities. This can mean that you have forgotten all about your passions and the kind of joy, happiness, and fulfillment that came with doing what you love. A reversed strength card in a reading might also mean that one is experiencing depression because of a number of reasons and because of that, it is draining all of the happiness from their lives.'
    ,'Chariot\ndirection, control, willpower\nThe Chariot tarot card is all about overcoming challenges and gaining victory through maintaining control of your surroundings. This perfect control and confidence allows the charioteer to emerge victorious in any situation. The use of strength and willpower are critical in ensuring that you overcome the obstacles that lie in your path. The Chariots message comes to make you stronger as you strive to achieve your goals. The key message that he brings to you is that you must maintain focus, confidence, and determination through a process that will be full of winding turns and detours. '
    ,'Chariot Reversed\nlack of control, lack of direction, aggression\nThe reversed Chariots appearance in a reading can help you become aware of both your aggression, and your lack of willpower. It may either be saying that you are lacking in focus, motivation or direction, or that you are being warped by your obsession with your goals. In the former case, let the Chariot be a reminder that you can emerge victorious as long as you can gather the courage to do so. In the latter, your impulses may be another factor that you must rein in. To see the Chariot in reverse may suggest that you need to come to terms with the fact that you cannot always be in control.'
    ,'Lovers\npartnerships, duality, union\nThe primary meaning within the Lovers is harmony, attractiveness, and perfection in a relationship. The trust and the unity that the lovers have gives each of them confidence and strength, empowering the other. The bond that they have created is very strong, and it can indicate that the two are joined in marriage, and other close and intimate relationships.'
    ,'Lovers Reversed\nloss of balance, one-sidedness, disharmony\nThe Lovers reversed can point to both inner and outer conflicts that you are dealing with. The disharmony can make daily life difficult and could be putting pressure on your relationships. You should take time to think about what you are punishing yourself for, so you can fix them or let them go. At this time, you should also think about your personal values and belief system to make sure that they are aligned with what you want from your life. A break in communication could be another possible interpretation. The foundation for your relationships may be cut off, creating an imbalance between you and your partner or loved ones. The unity normally present within the card has become lopsided. '
    ,'Hieerophant\ntradition, conformity, morality, ethics\nTo see the Hierophant in a reading is to embrace the conventional, for it suggests that you have a certain desire to actually follow a process which has been well established. It also suggests that you want to stay within certain conventional bounds of what could be considered an orthodox approach. So, instead of being innovative, you will be adapting to certain beliefs and systems which are already put in place and are existing.'
    ,'Hieerophant Reversed\nrebellion, subversiveness, new approaches\nWhen you see the Hierophant in reverse, it may mean that you are feeling particularly restricted and even constrained from too many structures and rules. As a result, you have lost quite a lot of control as well as flexibility in your life. You have a particularly strong will and desire to go ahead and regain control as well as to break free from the shackles of convention. You are tempted to try unorthodox approaches or to function in a way which defies social ties and norms. The Hierophant reversal meaning is mostly about questioning certain traditions and making sure that whatever it is that you do is the right thing for you in this certain moment.'
    ,'Emperor\nauthority, structure, control, fatherhood\nItâ€™s all about control when it comes to the Emperor, for this card means authority, regulation, organization and a fatherliness. The Emperor represents a strategic thinker who sets out plans that he must see through. He is a symbol of the masculine principle - the paternal figure in life that gives structure, creates rules and systems, and imparts knowledge. Where the Empress"s desire for their kingdom is to create happiness, the emperor desires to foster honor and discipline. He guides with a firm hand, following the calling of the crown above all else. Though he is a ruler, he understands that to reign is also to serve - thus he acts rationally and according to what is for the greater good of the kingdom.'
    ,'Emperor Reversed\ntyranny, rigidity, coldness\nThe Emperor reversed is a sign of abused authoritative power. In your social life, it can manifest in the overreach of power from a father figure or a possessive partner. In career readings, it could be coming from a superior. It presents a man who wants to take control of your actions and makes you feel powerless.  It could also be that you are playing the part of a weak ruler, hatching a plan to avoid the tasks that come with having responsibility. Perhaps you aspire for a career that is more flexible than one that is governed by strict rules.'
    ,'Empress\nmotherhood, fertility, nature\nThe Empress shows us how deeply we are embedded to our femininity. Femininity could be associated with fertility, expression, creativity and nurturing among many other aspects. It therefore calls you to connect with beauty and bring happiness to your life. Understand yourself and get in touch with your sensuality so that you can attract life circumstances to bring happiness and joy. She is a signal that be kind to yourself, to take care of yourself.'
    ,'Empress Reversed\ndependence, smothering, emptiness, nosiness\nThe Empress reversed indicates that you have lost too much of your own willpower and strength because you have started placing too much effort and concern to other peopleâ€™s affairs. While the Empressâ€™s nature is of showering her loved ones with attention and care, this can sometimes go overboard. You might be neglecting your own needs, or even smothering the ones you love with your well-intentioned actions.\nIn a role reversal, perhaps a reversed Empress is finding her way into your life; it could also mean that you are relying on others to take care of you, and make decisions for you. You need to work towards removing this influence on your life, and build confidence in your own actions. Always try as much as you can to ensure that you solve matters on your own.'
    ,'High Priestess\nintuitive, unconscious, inner voice\nThe meaning of the High Priestess is related with inner knowledge. Her appearance in a reading can signify that it is time for you to listen to your intuition rather than prioritizing your intellect and conscious mind. When the High Priestess shows up it can depict an archetype known as the divine feminine - the mysterious female that understands and holds the answers to the deep unknowns; religion, self, nature. She represents someone that is intuitive, and beginning to open to her or his spirituality. Meditation, prayer and new spiritual work is indicated. '
    ,'High Priestess Reversed\nlack of center, lost inner voice, repressed feelings \nWhen it comes to the High Priestess reversed, it can mean that you are finding it difficult to listen to your intuition. It is time for you to meditate and try new approach, for at this moment, the rational approach will not work. Something has been telling you to follow your gut, but you may be ignoring the call. There is a lot of confusion around you, and your actions may feel contrary to what you know is right. You must never be afraid to ask questions of yourself that may illuminate a new path forward for you, one that is more authentic to your inner self and your individual values.'
    ,'Magician\nwillpower, desire, creation, manifestation\nThe Magician is the representation of pure willpower. With the power of the elements and the suits, he takes the potential innate in the fool and molds it into being with the power of desire. He is the connecting force between heaven and earth, for he understands the meaning behind the words "as above so below" - that mind and world are only reflections of one another. Remember that you are powerful, create your inner world, and the outer will follow.'
    ,'Magician Reversed\ntrickery, illusions, out of touch\nWhen you obtain the Magician reversed, it might mean its time for you to implement some changes. While right side up, the Magician represents true power, the reversed Magician is a master of illusion. The magic that he performs is one of deception and trickery. You may be lured in by the showmanship of his arts, but behind that there may be an intention to manipulate for selfish gain. Getting this card might mean that there is someone who pretends to have your best interests at hand when the opposite is true. '
    ,'Fool\ninnocence, new beginnings, free spirit\nThe Fool card is numbered 0, which is considered to be a number of infinite potential. Consider him a blank slate, for The Fool has yet to develop a clear personality. He is the symbol of innocence - his journey to come will shape his character yet.\nTo see the The Fool generally means a beginning of a new journey, one where you will be filled with optimism and freedom from the usual constraints in life. When we meet him, he approaches each day as an adventure, in an almost childish way. He believes that anything can happen in life and there are many opportunities that are lying out there, in the world, waiting to be explored and developed. He leads a simple life, having no worries, and does not seem troubled by the fact that he cannot tell what he will encounter ahead.'
    ,'Fool Reversed\nrecklessness, taken advantage of, inconsideration \nWhen you land on the reversed Fool in your reading, you can generally find his more negative characteristics being on display. It can mean that you are literally acting like a fool by disregarding the repercussions of your actions. Like the youth depicted in the card, you dont see how dangerous of a position you find yourself in.\nA reversed Fool card can show that you are living in the moment and not planning for the future. The reversed Fool meaning serves as caution that you should be more aware so as not to be taken advantage of.'
    ,'Ace of Wands\ncreation, willpower, inspiration, desire\nWhen you draw the Ace of Wands, it is an indicator that you should just go for it. Take the chance and pursue an idea that you have in mind. Take the first steps to start the creative project. The Ace of Wands calls out to you to follow your instincts. If you think that the project that youve been dreaming of is a good idea, and then just go ahead and do it. '
    ,'Ace of Wands Reversed\nlack of energy, lack of passion, boredom\nThe reversed Ace of Wands indicates trials and tribulations that you will face in the near future. You might not have any direction, which leads to being uninspired or unmotivated. At this point of your life, you might not know what you really want to do. You donâ€™t know how to get out of the slump.\nIn the case that you already have a goal, you are not excited to achieve it. When you draw a reversed Ace of Wands, you should consider taking some time off to allow inspiration to come to you. You feel weighed down by your current commitments and responsibilities that you canâ€™t come up with new ideas, or muster the passion to push forward in your projects.'
    ,'Two of Wands\nplanning, making decisions, leaving home\nThe Two of Wands is a more mature version of the ace of wands, meaning that that this tarot card is all about planning and moving forward â€“ progression. Look at it this way; you have already set out to achieve a particular task, which means you have turned an idea into a realistic plan. Such a plan will require fulfillment and therefore you have to progress from just having the plan to actually achieving what you set out for.'
    ,'Two of Wands Reversed\nfear of change, playing safe, bad planning\nThe Two of Wands reversed meaning suggests the need to set up long-term goals. Begin the process of setting up your goals by identifying what to you is important. Proceed by planning how you intend on achieving such goals.\nAnother Two of Wands reversal meaning suggests that you have ignored important fine points associated with planning your future. Lack of proper planning could be the reason for your downfall.\nOther interpretations can include either overconfidence or lack of patience, both are possible in bringing you disarray in your path forward.'
    ,'Three of Wands\nlooking ahead, expansion, rapid growth\nThe meaning of the Three of Wands hints that you are planning or going to plan for the future with more conviction. This could mean that everything around your plans is going smoothly, as you have taken the time to plan your future, and are taking steps to turn plans into action. It hints that you are perhaps creating a stable foundation for yourself.\nThe symbolism within the Three of Wands is that opportunities that can take place to widen your horizons in many areas. It also is a warning to keep your mind open as better opportunities could open up to you. As you take steps towards achieving what you set out to do, you are also becoming more aware of opportunities that are coming your way, and this could be take you out of your comfort zone. This pushes you to sometimes embrace change, and to start thinking in the long-term.'
    ,'Three of Wands Reversed\nobstacles, delays, frustration\nThe reversed Three of Wands indicates that you may have been embarking on personal journeys or developments, but you have not received the achievements that you were hoping for. This could be due to delays or road blocks. Despite all this, the card reminds you that all of your work has not been for nothing, but rather that it has helped you with your personal strength and fortitude.\nThe Three of Wands reversed can also mean you need to take some time to plan your future. This is especially true if you have not started on your long term goals or have become overwhelmed by the tasks that you face now, or will have to face soon. You are only reacting and not acting with thought and deliberation'
    ,'Four of Wands\n community, home, celebration\nThe overall meaning of the Four of Wands is that it heralds celebration as well as a harmonious, happy and relaxed home environment. In terms of numerology, the number four symbolizes stability as well as particularly reliable foundations. These are associated with a period of happiness and balance.\nThe symbolism within the Four of Wands poses that this is the perfect time for you to get together with close people such as friends and family. This could be with or without any special occasion. Oftentimes the card is known to reflect a period of holidays when you are together with your friends and family for an extended period of time. It might also be suggesting for you to invite your closest friends for a great and intimate dinner and share a laugh or two.'
    ,'Four of Wands Reversed\nlack of support, transience, home conflicts\nIf the upright position of the card reflects balance, stability, and harmony, the reversal position of Four of Wands implies that there is a breakdown or complete lack of harmony in your family or in your home. Itâ€™s highly likely that there is a lot of tension between the members of your family or other loved ones. If you have completed something that is important to you, you are expecting to share it with those that are closest to you, and to come home to a welcome celebration, but instead, you find a lack of support. This may leave you feeling rather uncertain when it comes to your own relationships as well as the things that you can and cannot depend on.'
    ,'Five of Wands\ncompetition, rivalry, conflict\nFive of Wands suggests that there is form of conflict in oneâ€™s life. This may be an existing conflict or one that is brewing and may eventually blow up in ones face. It may also depict a problem in communication, for example in a situation where no one really wants to listen to the other - meaning that no agreement or understanding takes place. The five men may signify problems in a group of people who are not patient enough to listen to what anyone else is saying. They only want to be heard, and since none of the others will listen, they all argue at once.'
    ,'Five of Wands Reversed\navoiding conflict, respecting differences\nThe Five of Wands reversed meaning can be that your natural method of dealing with disagreements is avoiding any kind of conflict by getting away from that place as fast as you can. Sometimes this can be regarded as a good thing, but other times, it may lead to a number of issues that are brewing up within you, for which you will have to address soon. On the other hand, it can also mean that you have worked through your troubles and that you do not have any more issues to worry about.'
    ,'Six of Wands \nvictory, success, public reward\nThis particular card is all about public recognition, victory, and success. Not only have you managed to properly succeed in achieving all of your goals, but you are also being publicly acknowledged for them and the results that youâ€™ve managed to attain. You may have received an award or some sort of public acclaim.\nThe card is indicative that you have managed to harness the strengths and talents that you have within you in an attempt to bring a particularly successful outcome in your life. You have managed to properly get through the confusion which is brought by the card before this one â€“ the Five of Wands, and managed to properly minimize distractions, thus successfully focusing on your goals and achieving them.'

    ,'Page of Wands \nexploration, excitement, freedom,\nWhen we see the Page of Wands, we see a youth with enormous excitement and curiosity for the world. He knows what to do, he has the passion to succeed, but due to his inexperience and maybe a little fear of the unknown, his ideas remain abstract. He identifies new worlds to explore, new opportunities he could take advantage of quite easily, and he is even gifted with the "big picture" vision needed to succeed. Even with all of this, he still has the tendency to either remain dormant, or get easily distracted with one idea after the other. If he doesnt learn to control this, it might be that he squanders the opportunities to advance himself.'
    ,'Page of Wands Reversed\nlack of direction, procrastination, creating conflict \nWith the Page of Wands reversed, it tends to emphasize the more negative character traits of the upright version.

    ,'King of Wands\nbig picture, leader, overcoming challenges\nThe meaning of the upright position of the King of Wands represents pure energy. Unlike the other wands cards in the deck however, this particular one is not focused on pure creativity. Instead, this king is actually way more likely to take an idea and to decisively implement it himself. The King of Wands is a natural born leader of people, and he is also extremely capable. Once the king sets for himself a certain aim or a goal, he is going to conveniently stick to it in order to ensure that it becomes a reality.'
    ,'King of Wands Reversed\nimpulsive, overbearing, unachievable expectations\nThe negative aspect of the card is associated, as you may guess, with a feeling of arrogance.

You are ready to pick up the two remaining cups which are still full and go on with your life in full force.'
    ,'Six of Cups\nfamiliarity, happy memories, healing\nThe Six of Cups upright generally represents generosity, naÃ¯ve happiness, and childhood. It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time, whether it was when you were a child, teenager, or young adult. Many times, these memories are things of the past, which reflect the aspects of ourselves that have vanished. You may feel that remembering these times is the only way to feel happy.

    ,'Eight of Cups\nwalking away, disillusionment, leaving behind\nThe Eight of Cups signifies time for change or transition, by means of walking away from something. Just like a caterpillar has to die before transforming into a beautiful butterfly, we all need to transform ourselves in our lives from time to time.

And in the end, they almost always end up following wherever the waves of life take them.\nOn the other hand, you may be aware of what you need to do.

    ,'Knight of Cups\nfollowing the heart, idealist, romantic\nThe truth is that the Knight of Cups is the most feminine amongst all the Knight cards in the tarot. Its important to note though, that this doesnâ€™t even slightly suggest that he is any less of a worthy knight. It implies that he is in proper touch with his emotions and his intuition, and that he uses them for his own well-being and during his many romance and seduction quests. He is usually quite attractive and charming to others, regardless of their gender. '

This would be a good time to lay back and rationally think your way through each stage rather than acting on impulse, since everything appears in a blur and is not very clear at that moment. It might also be a good time to seek advice since things may not be as they seem.'
    ,'Two of Swords\ndifficult choices, indecision, stalemate\nWhen we see the Two of Swords in a reading, we are encountering a stalemate. Two equal and opposing forces are joined in battle, and there seems to be no end in sight. This wasnt what you had in mind when you chanced to walk down this path, and you find yourself caught in the middle. Without something, or someone to intervene, this may continue indefinitely. We find ourselves in a situation where we must make a choice, we can side with one part of the situation, or we can side with the other.

Do not worry, the more important thing here is to make a choice, from then on, we can deal with whatever consequences come.'
    ,'Three of Swords\nheartbreak, suffering, grief\nThe Three of Swords depicts the message of rejection, betrayal, hurt and discouragement. In moments like these, we are well served by the mind. If you can think logically about it and prepare for the experience, the impact of this pain may be minimized.\nBut remember too, that pain and grief are a normal part of life, because they make us appreciate what joy and happiness we have, as well as teaching us. It is through pain that we learn to be avoid mistakes that could lead us into danger and grief. It is therefore a necessity in the journey of life. The Three of Swords therefore is a depiction of suffering that is meant to make us stronger, more careful and more vigilant.'
    ,'Three of Swords Reversal\nrecovery, forgiveness, moving on\nThe Three of Swords reversed indicates that have faced a recent loss, a break-up or a moment of grief.

Although you may still be thinking of your past suffering, this card may be a signal that its time to let go and look forwards towards life ahead of you, because there is much for you to enjoy.\nMany donâ€™t see this, and they end up being immersed in their own pain for too long, delaying their own recovery process. Donâ€™t focus too much on what happened, renew your emotions and gather your courage. The reversed Three of Swords card is here to let you know that all difficult moments pass - they are not there to stay, and when we fall, we can also rise again.'
    ,'Four of Swords\nrest, restoration, contemplation\nAfter the time of chaos, anger and pain depicted in the Three of Swords, the Four of Swords can signal that it is time to retreat. The Four of Swords is a moment of rest. Whether this is from a choice to withdraw, or whether it is from pure exhaustion, it is not clear. We are still tender from the wounds that were inflicted, and the battle weapons still hang above us as a grim reminder of what was lost. In order to continue and re-emerge in your daily life, you must take the time now to take a breather. There is always the faint fear that something more is bound to happen again and it is advisable that you take all chances to rest.'
    ,'Four of Swords Reversal\nrestlessness, burnout, stress\nAlthough the Four of Swords card in a reading could mean itâ€™s time for healing, a reversed card could mean restlessness. Your heart is willing to relax, but this is not what your mind wants. You feel that you have too much that is depending on you. Following this path is not advised, as it could have affects on your health.\nYou can continue to fight, but sometimes that is ineffectual and you must have enough awareness of your own strength to decide when to back out. To rest, to retreat, is a means of self love sometimes, and though you may try to push ahead, that will only make it difficult for you in the long term.'
    ,'Five of Swords\nunbridled ambition, win at all costs, sneakiness\nThis card indicates that you are engaging in a conflict of some nature. It can also suggest a disagreement with others, which leads to hostility and tension. Despite the fact that you think youâ€™ve won, you might still lose in the big picture, because you have annoyed or hurt those that you have argued with, and as a result, you are on the road to isolating yourself. Perhaps, at the moment, you believed that it was more important to be right rather than appreciate and understand where the other side was coming from.\nRight now, its important to attempt to pick up the pieces. You still have the chance to act while the conflict is still fresh. You may feel as if everyone and everything is against you. You might also lose some friends along the way. This is why you will need to make a significant decision about your point of view. What is more important to you? Mutual progress, or winning? This might require you to stand up to a conflict within yourself.'
    ,'Five of Swords Reversal\nlingering resentment, desire to reconcile, forgiveness\nIn the upright position, the Five of Swords is a card of tension, conflict, and disagreement. The Five of Swords reversal meaning shows you that all you want is for that particular period to be over so that you can forget and forgive. Because you are beginning to understand that winning is not everything, you will be capable of focusing your energy on something a lot more constructive and positive.\nAnother interpretation of this card in reverse is that the conflict you are experiencing is actually going to become more upsetting as you realize that there can only be losers. These are terms that you need to come to grips with'
    ,'Six of Swords\ntransition, leaving behind, moving on\nThe meaning of the Six of Swords is that you are experiencing a transition of some kind, but one that is not happy and filled with regret. This transition will most likely be the result of decisions you made in the past, and now they are forcing you to leave something behind in order to move forward. Despite your sadness, you need to remember that moving on is the ideal option for your future.'
    ,'Six of Swords Reversal\nemotional baggage, unresolved issues, resisting transition\nThe Six of Swords reversed can indicate that you have been trying to move on and make the transitions you need. However, you may be experiencing challenges making these a reality. You may keep returning to the past, whether its because there are issues that are not resolved, or you are questioning your decisions.\nAnother Six of Swords reversal meaning is that you have been resisting the transitions that life is giving you. You may feel that you are being forced into making moves before you wanted to or you do not want to move at all. In this case, you should think about the benefits of the moves, instead of the drawbacks. Like Orpheus in the underworld, you must only look ahead and not backwards, for if you do look backwards, you risk falling apart.'
    ,'Seven of Swords\ndeception, trickery, tactics and strategy\nThe Seven of Swords in general, is said to be about betrayal and deception. When you get this card, it may imply that you or someone else in your life is having difficulty getting away with something. There are instances when we are forced to be sneaky, hoping that we will not be discovered. When we are found out, we have to face the consequences - whether its embarrassment, punishment, or worse. Sometimes this happens when there are instances when you had to think on your feet, and did something that was somewhat shrewd and out of character. Now there is a danger of the secret coming out.'
    ,'Seven of Swords Reversal\ncoming clean, rethinking approach, deception\nThe Seven of Swords reversed can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the other cards within the reading. It can suggest firstly a need to change your approach - the tactics youve been using are not working. While upright, this card can stand for a cunning victory attained by deception and trickery, the reversal can stand for either a more extreme version of such behavior. Or instead, a kind of renewal of conscience. You or someone in your circle may be deciding to unburden themselves with their guilt, and come clean about some piece of manipulation they have been involved in. Trust has been broken, but with a confession, you may be on the road to repairing it. There is a desire here to try and do things in a different way, one that is collaborative rather than independent.'
    ,'Eight of Swords\nimprisonment, entrapment, self-victimization\nThe general meaning in the Eight of Swords is that of a feeling of being trapped and victimized. You may feel powerless because, in your mind, you feel that changing the situation might be beyond you. This feeling of helplessness that you have, the feeling that you have no agency in your life, has played a major role in making your situation worse.\nSurrendering oneâ€™s power to an unknown entity, whether its fate, or God, the government or something else means that you are giving away your own personal responsibility to affect change. You have willingly relinquished the drivers seat in the journey of your own life, and it isnt going well for you. It is advisable for you to avoid making an important decision at this time since your judgment is likely clouded.'
    ,'Eight of Swords Reversal\nself acceptance, new perspective, freedom\nGetting the reversed Eight of Swords is a good sign, since it shows maturity and self-acceptance, and a recognition of ones own power and responsibility - especially after a long struggle of doubt. It means that one is capable of making conscious decisions because they are confident in who they are, and their power to affect change in both themselves and the world. Its time to free ones self from the past and proverbially clear out their closet, creating room for new things and experiences.'
    ,'Nine of Swords\nanxiety, hopelessness, trauma\nThe Nine of Swords is often associated with fear and anxiety, about all the things that worry you and keep you up at night. Sometimes this card can be associated with trauma - one which may be shameful for you to confide with others about, and all the psychological responses that come from experiencing that trauma.'
    ,'Nine of Swords Reversal\nhope, reaching out, despair\nTo come across the Nine of Swords reversed still signals something similar to the upright version - that you may find yourself being terrorized by nightmares, by anxiety and stress. Some trauma from your past is coming back, and you find the grief of unresolved issues overwhelming.\nBut here we also see hope, at least there is the desire to leave this nightmare. You must understand that this suffering will not cease until you yourself put in the effort to leave it. There is much work that you must do to drag yourself towards release. But just as you have a ways out, you must understand that you can still fall deeper into despair. Your job is to avoid that outcome, if you push forward you may find yourself out, but if you do not, you may find yourself sinking deeper.'
    ,'Ten of Swords\nfailure, collapse, defeat\nThe Ten of Swords indicate a major disaster of some sort. It shows that a certain force of extreme magnitude has come to hit you in your life - one that you may have not foreseen. There is a sense of betrayal that is indicated here, for the character is stabbed in the back. This seems to be a reminder that despite how much we try, we cannot control everything - there are things that are beyond our ability to change. Here, this situation is unavoidable.\nThe tale of the suit of swords is a powerful metaphor, one that ends in tragedy. The swords are a symbol of the intellect, of intelligence and logic, and yet we find the final culmination of this suit a complete and total defeat of the spirit. We must realize that the swords are a weapon that can have immense potential for destruction or for good. The story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused.'
    ,'Ten of Swords Reversal\ncant get worse, only upwards, inevitable endWhen we see any version of the Ten of Swords , the feelings are powerful. Whether reversed or upright, the card signals the finality of defeat. There is no way to avoid this tragedy - it has happened over a long course of events that have been a long time coming.\nWith the reversal though, also comes to a recognition that you have hit rock bottom, there is no more that is left for you to give. With that also comes the release that things can only get better and the cycle can start anew. But like with the eight and nine of swords, this release must be initiated by you. There is an opportunity being presented here to correct what has hurt you, but you must make the effort to climb out yourself. What has happened was terrible, but everyone has a part in the responsibility.'
    ,'Page of Swords\ncuriosity, restlessness, mental energy\nBright and alert, the Page of Swords is someone who never seems to run out of ideas. She is curious, always asking questions, and gifted with a sharp tongue and quick wit to match. Her aptitude for language also makes her an incredible communicator, and with her love of ideas, you may find her always engaged in some passionate debate.\nShe seems to thrive on almost a kind of nervous energy, as if there was too much inside her to say, the wheels in her head always turning. As a news bearer, she may bring news that is represented by her suit - particularly, gossip, legal matters, agreements. Alternatively, you may find yourself required to use her energy - be alert, keep your eyes open and stay sharp and vigilant.'
    ,'Page of Swords Reversal\ndeception, manipulation, all talk\nWhen the Page of Swords is reversed, all the negative characteristics of her come out - and she may become almost dangerous. Being gifted with a sharp and alert mind, she may be using it for deception and manipulation. The sword that she wields may be used to create pain, her natural gift for language turned to a weapon. She may lack the understanding or the maturity to understand the suffering that she causes, feeling the rush that one gets upon lashing out. On the other hand, this page may be someone of empty words or promises - who though loves talking, does not really talk about much of substance. Take care to show strength and action behind your words, for you may be damaging your reputation.'
    ,'Queen of Swords\ncomplexity, perceptiveness, clear mindedness\nThe Queen of Swords is an archetype of an older, wiser feminine intellect. She could be thought of as the most masculine of the all the queens, and may come off as quite stern and emotionless. This card represents the importance of making judgments without relying on emotion alone. The Queen of Swords beckons you to look at all the facts before making a decision. This queen does have compassion, which is why she has her hand reaching outwards in offering, but she wants to connect to people using an understanding that is intellectual.'

You have to start thinking more objectively, because your emotions could lead you astray. Take the time to look at the situation using various facts and use your head to create a clearer picture of what is really going on. Only then, can you decide what your next move should be.\nWhen reversed, the Queen of Swords can also be quite bitter, coldhearted, or resentful. You may have started to isolate yourself for a number of reasons, but the outside world could be taking this in the wrong way. You may have some explaining to do, especially if your relationships end up being stressed by your desire for solitude.'
    ,'King of Swords \nhead over heart, discipline, truth\nThe King of Swords appearing in a reading suggests that you should remain objective in your current situation - you must establish truth by sticking to the facts.

Another interpretation is that you may also be a loose cannon, especially where there are angry outbursts and impulses.'
    ,'Knight of Swords\naction, impulsiveness, defending beliefs\nWhen we are thoroughly obsessed by a certain idea and strongly wish to manifest it, we are oftentimes so blinded by the actual desire for its fulfillment that we fail to note the difficulties which we may come across, or the actions and consequences that it could bring. The Knight of Swords is a very powerful figure that is full of life as well as energy. This needs to be balanced with a proper and actual realization of compassion and responsibility.'
    ,'Knight of Swords Reversal\nno direction, disregard for consequences, unpredictability\nThe reversed Knight of Swords suggests incredible impatience, impulsiveness alongside his bursting with energy. This Knight of Swords has a lot of energy but lacks any kind of direction, and this oftentimes results in them making rather rash decisions as well as pulling down other people with them.\nTheir thoughts are oftentimes scattered throughout without any actual organization or logic. They are most likely disorganized and unprepared for the things that they actually want to achieve. The Knight of Swords reversal meaning indicates that you still have a lot of miles to walk in order to get the valuable life experience that you need in order to overcome adversities along the way. This is something to consider.'
    ,'Ace of Pentacles\nopportunity, prosperity, new venture\nThe aces in the tarot are all indicative of new beginnings.

    ,'Three of Pentacles\nteamwork, collaboration, building\nThe threes in the tarot represent the successful completion of a goal - it takes the sources of energy in the ace and the twos and adds a foundational factor, and usually involves a group of some sort. In this scenario, the upright three of pentacles meaning is that there is a successful achievement of all the requirements to pursue your business, deal, venture or any other kind of endeavor.

You may find that people are not listening to others, and everyone is working for themselves. This difference in motives and ambitions yields complications. If you can be the first to reach out and give everyone a chance to be heard and considered, perhaps this project has a chance to move forward.'
    ,'Four of Pentacles\nconservation, frugality, security\nThe Four of Pentacles card is capable of generating both negative and positive perceptions. On one hand, the card signifies that you have successfully managed to accomplish much of your goals and you have managed to attain a significant material wealth in the process. However, on the other hand, there is a significant chance that you will start valuing things only for their material worth. You have worked hard to get to the point where you are now, and it is absolutely natural for your to desire to make sure that you remain stable.

    ,'Six of Pentacles Reversal\nstrings attached, stinginess, power and domination\nThe Six of Pentacles reversed can suggest that charity can be one-way. If you have loaned someone money, you should not be expecting your money to be paid back, or your favor to be returned in the future.

Gone is the upright generosity in her suit, she can be selfish and even envious when others successes seem greater than hers. Upright, her home is usually a sanctuary for her guests, but reversed it may instead be slovenly - she loses the ability to take care of herself and her surroundings. Her focus on the material may manifest negatively, making her greedy, and yet lacking in her sense of duty and capability. How can she ground herself again, how can she re-enter the sacred relationship she naturally feels with the earth and all its living creatures?'
    ,'King of Pentacles\nabundance, prosperity, security\nWhen we meet the King of Pentacles, we feel immediately his regal and generous presence.
